# Fault-Diagnosis-and-Tolerence
This system is a part of assignment, the aim of which was to detect fault in a three tank system (for e.g. leakage) and be able to accommodate for that fault. The files consist of the 
simulink based simulation. The detailed description of this system is in the pdf file "fault.pdf"
